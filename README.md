# GDG Hampton Roads - AngularJS Code Lab

## Setup

Setting up the Code Lab is pretty simple if you have [Git][git] installed (if you are looking at Github, I would hope so). Just do the following:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Change to the appropriate branch (part1 or part2): `git checkout part1`
3. Profit. (At least in knowledge of AngularJS)

## What is in the codelab parts?

The following material is contained in the two branches of the codelab:
[part1][part1] and [part2][part2]. The [master][master] branch contains both parts.

### part1 branch

1. Application Setup
2. Interpolation
3. Controllers
4. Built in directives
    1. ngRepeat
    2. ngClass
    3. ngTemplate and ngInclude
    4. ngModel 

### part2 branch

5. Scope
6. ngCloak
7. Filters
8. Decorators
9. Dependency Injection
10. Factories
11. Providers
12. Services
13. Directives
14. Routing
15. E2E Testing
