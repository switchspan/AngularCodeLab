# GDG Hampton Roads - AngularJS Code Lab

## Setup

Setting up the Code Lab is pretty simple if you have [Git][git] installed (if you are looking at Github, I would hope so). Just do the following:

1. Clone this repo to your local machine
2. Change to the appropriate branch (part1 or part2): `git checkout part1`
3. Profit. (At least in knowledge of AngularJS)
